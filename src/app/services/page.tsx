            I was using an Intel-based 16” MacBook Pro prior to this and the
            difference is night and day. I’ve never heard the fans turn on a
            single time, even under the incredibly heavy loads I put it through
            with our various launch simulations.

          <Tool title="Social Media Strategy">
            The only display on the market if you want something HiDPI and

            They don’t make keyboards the way they used to. I buy these any time
            I see them go up for sale and keep them in storage in case I need
            parts or need to retire my main.

            I don’t care if it’s missing all of the fancy IDE features everyone
            else relies on, Sublime Text is still the best text editor ever
            made.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="iTerm2">
            I’m honestly not even sure what features I get with this that aren’t
            just part of the macOS Terminal but it’s what I use.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="TablePlus">
            Great software for working with databases. Has saved me from
            building about a thousand admin interfaces for my various projects
            over the years.

            We started using Figma as just a design tool but now it’s become our

            the collaboration features to be the real hook.

          <Tool title="Reflect">
            Using a daily notes system instead of trying to keep things
            organized by topics has been super powerful for me. And with
            Reflect, it’s still easy for me to keep all of that stuff
            discoverable by topic even though all of my writing happens in the
            daily note.
